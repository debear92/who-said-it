# User Experience

## User Stories

## Design

- To guide the development of the website wireframes were designed through [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). These wireframe were only an initial guide and some features appear different in the final product.

- A color pallet was generated using [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/). I started from the color #80000, Maroon, the title of a Taylor Swift song that I really like.

# Features

## Responsivness

- The website was built to be fully responsive on screens from 300px wide and above.
- The responsivness has been reached with the use of different methods, mainly media queries and the use of flexbox.
