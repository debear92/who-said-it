# User Experience

## User Stories

## Design

# Features

## Responsivness

- The website was built to be fully responsive on screens from 300px wide and above.
- The responsivness has been reached with the use of different methods, mainly media queries and the use of flexbox.

## Features To Implement

# Technologies Used 

- Wireframes were designed in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) - to write the code.
- [Github](https://github.com/) - to store the repository of the website.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - to deploy and host the website.
- [Google Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - to troubleshoot issues and test responsivness through various screen sizes.

# Testing

To test my website I have opened it on different devices, to see if it was working as expected.

# Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
  - Once you've selected your branch and root directory, click "Save" to deploy your website. GitHub will generate a URL where your website will be hosted (usually in the format username.github.io/repository-name).
